###Attack Reaction

**Cell Prep:**

| Volume required per RX = | 500          |
|--------------------------|--------------|
| Inducer volume =         | 95           |
| OD required =            | 2            |
| Volume started =         | 12000        |
|                          |              |
| Grow to OD of:           | 0.1028806584 |
| Resuspend in:            | 500          |
| pippette into inducer:   | 405          |

Take 2 x 12 mL tubes of cell suspension and spin down at 8k rcf for 8 min in chilled incubator.

Resuspend and add to inducer

Load each strain in syringe

**Reaction Scheme:**
When cells meet in droplet device each will be at OD = 1

Droplet generation was done with an ice pack on the syringes.
The heated stage was used to monitor temperature which was about 28C
The outlet tubing fed into a reaction tube in a heat block on ice.
Droplets were generated for about 2.5 hours, and then the reaction tube was placed in a heat block at 37 C for 30 minutes.

**typically 0.1 ug/mL of CSP is used, it was doubled in this case to encourage transformation*

**Preparing Working Stocks:**

| Working Stocks | Stock  | M9   | dH2O |
|----------------|--------|------|------|
| CSP            | 25 uL  | 1 mL | -    |
| BSA            | 100 uL | 1 mL | -    |
| CaCl2          | 100 uL | -    | 1 mL |

**Emlusion Breaking**

Starting with 200 uL cells in emlusion add 500 uL CAT

Spin down for 30 seconds at 100 x g (in simple centrifuge at heidi's bench)

Pipette oil out from bottom

add two times volume of pico break and gently rock tube

spin again for 1 min at 100-1000 x g

pipette out top(cells) ~ 700 uL

Transfer to another tube and bring up to 2 mL with CAT

Incubate for 1 hour at 37 C in a heat block

**Dilution Scheme**

200 uL cell emulsion was transfered in to 2 mL CAT previously and incubated for 1 hour

150 uL pipetted into 1.5 mL CAT to make 10^-2, 3xRNS, 3xRS, 3xRN, one for further dilution

150 uL pipetted into 1.5 mL CAT to make 10^-3

150 uL pipetted into 1.5 mL CAT to make 10^-4

150 uL pipettd into 1.5 mL CAT to make 10^-5, 3xR, 3xS

**Plates are filled with:**

1. 3 mL CAT agar
2. 1.5 mL cells + 1.5 mL agar
3. 3 mL CAT agar
4. 3 mL Drug agar
