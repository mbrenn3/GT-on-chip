Conception:

Microfluidic fabrication was used to make a droplet generating device capable of co-encasulating two strains of strep for the observation of cell-cell attack and gene transfer. The device is capable of makeing droplets of 500 femtoliters in volume (10 um in diameter) in a continous phase of oil. The two strains can be kept seperate until they meet in the droplet. The droplets can then be incubated on chip in a monolayer for observation of cell-cell attack.

The the droplets are formed via a flow focusing method. A 5 um wide by 10 um tall neck is used to form droplets this size. With a flow rate of 3:1 oil:aqueous the device equlibrates forming monodisperse droplets.
