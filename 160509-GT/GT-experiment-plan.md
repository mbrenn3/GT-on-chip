1. Thaw at 0C in heater block ice bath one vial of each BOXMORRISON2016 # 1-20 (4/5/16 CP2204 OD 0.2), and # 21-40.
2. Transfer 200 uL, 100 uL, and 50 uL thawed cells in to 12 mL CDM + 1% CAT tubes. (calc total media)
3. Place tubes in water bath at 37C. Grow to 0.1 OD. Measure every 30 min. Use one blank tube of media to calibrate spectrophotometer.

Expect CP2215 to grow faster, may need to hold at room temp to let CP2204 catch up. Expect cells to double every 40 min.

4. Chill one tube of each strain when it reaches OD 0.1

5. Spin down tubes at 8kg for 8 min in chilled centrifuge, resuspend each in 1 mL chilled CDM, by vortexing for 2 x 20 seconds.
6. Combine tubes to make 2 mL cell mix, hold at 0C.
7. Transfer required amounts of cell mix and media with or without CSP to reaction tubes. (1 mL cryovials)

8. Place reaction tubes in heater block at 37C for 30 min.
9. Dilute 0.2 mL from each reaction tube in 2 mL CAT. Hold at 37C for 60 min.
10. Dilute for plating according to scheme
