###Attack Reaction

**Cell Prep:**

Take 2 x 12 mL tubes of cell suspension and spin down at 8k rcf for 8 min in chilled incubator.

Pour off supernatant and resuspend in 0.45 mL M9 to make OD 0.4.

Combine 300 uL of each strain to make 600 uL cells each at OD 0.2

Pull 500 uL of cell mix into syringe



Resuspend and add to inducer

Load each strain in syringe

**Reaction Scheme:**
When cells meet in droplet device each will be at OD = 1

Droplet generation was done with an ice pack on the syringes.
The heated stage was used to monitor temperature which was about 28C
The outlet tubing fed into a reaction tube in a heat block on ice.
Droplets were generated for about 2.5 hours, and then the reaction tube was placed in a heat block at 37 C for 30 minutes.

**Inducer Prep:**

Produce 700 uL of double strength inducer in M9:

**Emlusion Breaking**

Starting with 200 uL cells in emlusion add 500 uL CAT

Spin down for 30 seconds at 100 x g (in simple centrifuge at heidi's bench)

Pipette oil out from bottom

add two times volume of pico break and gently rock tube

spin again for 1 min at 100-1000 x g

pipette out top(cells) ~ 700 uL

Transfer to another tube and bring up to 2 mL with CAT

Incubate for 1 hour at 37 C in a heat block

**Dilution Scheme**

## Discussion and Conclusion

Cell pellet didn't make it?
Holding at 4C in M9 kills cells?
M9 old?

Should I check droplet formation in newly coated devices with CDM or CAT?

## Appendix:

To CAT from stock shelf add phosphate and glucose. For 300 mL CAT add 10 mL 0.5 M K2HPO4 (sterile filtered) and 3 mL 20% glucose (sterile filtered).
