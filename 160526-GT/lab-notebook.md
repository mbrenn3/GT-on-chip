**Attacker: CP2204** Rif-r Nov-s Sp-s. Stock 4/15/16. OD 0.2 BoxMorrison2016#1-20.

**Victim: Cp2215** Nov-r Sp-r. Stock 4/15/16 OD 0.2 BoxMorrison2016#21-40

Thaw Stock cells @ 0C. Dilute for growth in CDM + 1%CAT 12mL/tube.

Media batch CAT:4/6/16, CDM-NCNM:5/18/16 

To CAT from stock shelf add phosphate and glucose. For 300 mL CAT add 10 mL 0.5 M K2HPO4 (sterile filtered) and 3 mL 20% glucose (sterile filtered).

Grow to OD = 0.2 and chill to 0C for use.

###Attack Reaction

**Cell Prep:**

At OD 0.2 chill to 0C.

Take 2 x 12 mL tubes of cell suspension and spin down at 8k rcf for 8 min in chilled incubator.

Pour off supernatant and resuspend in 732 uL chilled M9 resulting in OD 3.278 

Combine cells suspensions to make 1.5 mL suspension, each strain at OD 1.63, hold at 0C.

**Reaction Scheme:**

Each reaction has cells of each strain at OD = 1.0 and the same inducer concentration.

Prepare reaction tubes according to following scheme. First add CDM, then M9 then inducer to each tube and finally cells. Mix/vortex tubes and gently centrifuge to bottom.

| Rx | %CDM | CDM | M9  | Inducer | Cells |
|----|------|-----|-----|---------|-------|
| 1  | 20   | 120 | 0   | 114     | 366   |
| 2  | 10   | 60  | 60  | 114     | 366   |
| 3  | 1    | 6   | 114 | 114     | 366*  |
| 4  | 0    | 0   | 120 | 114     | 366   |

**dilute 81.5 uL CDM in to 5 mL M9 and add 366 ul to Rx tube*


**Inducer Prep:**

| component | Stock     | Inducer    | Dilute by | working stock | Vol/RX | Total (4.2x(Vol/RX)) |
|-----------|-----------|------------|-----------|---------------|--------|----------------------|
| CSP       | 250 ug/mL | 0.2 ug/mL* | 50        | 5 ug/mL       | 24 uL  | 100.8 uL             |
| BSA       | 4%        | 0.04%      | 10        | 0.4%          | 60 uL  | 252 uL               |
| CaCl2     | 1 M       | 5 mM       | 10        | 100 mM        | 30 uL  | 126 uL               |

**typically 0.1 ug/mL of CSP is used, it was doubled in this case to encourage transformation*

**Preparing Working Stocks:**

| Working Stocks | Stock  | M9   | dH2O |
|----------------|--------|------|------|
| CSP            | 100 uL | 5 mL | -    |
| BSA            | 500 uL | 5 mL | -    |
| CaCl2          | 500 uL | -    | 5 mL |

Put reaction tubes in heat block at 37C for **35 minutes**. *reaction started at:*

After 30 min reaction the 600 uL reaction mixture was diluted into 6 mL CAT and incubated at 37C for 60 minutes. *Incubation started at:PM*
