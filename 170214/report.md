###Attack Reaction

**Cell Prep:**

| For 12 mL growth tubes: | OD  |
|-------------------------|-----|
| *Resuspend Volume (mL)  | 3   |
| *Desired OD in Reaction | 0.2 |
| Cell mix                | 0.4 |
| Each Srain resuspended  | 0.8 |
| ***Grow to***           | ***0.2*** |

1. Take 2 x 12 mL tubes of cell suspension and spin down at 8k rcf for 8 min in chilled incubator.

2. Pour off supernatant and resuspend in M9.

3. Combine 300 uL of each strain to make 600 uL cell mix.

4. Pull 350 uL of cell mix into syringe

**Inducer Prep:**

Produce 700 uL of double strength inducer in M9 and pull 500 uL into a syringe:

**typically 0.04 % of BSA is used, it was reduced to prevent fouling of hydrophobic device*

**Preparing Working Stocks:**

| Working Stocks | Stock  | M9   | dH2O |
|----------------|--------|------|------|
| CSP            | 25 uL  | 1 mL | -    |
| BSA            | 100 uL | 1 mL | -    |
| CaCl2          | 100 uL | -    | 1 mL |


**Reaction Scheme:**

Droplet production was performed in the cold room.
When cells combine with inducer in droplet device they will be diluted to 0.1 each.
The remaining cell mix and inducer was kept in the cold room to be combined as a control.
After the device chamber is full of emulsion the heated stage is turned to 37C, and the control cells are placed in a heated block.

*reaction started at:*

**Emlusion Breaking**


Emulsion is flowed from the device after 30 min into a reaction tube.
Both reaction tubes were taken out and placed at room temperature while emulsion breaking was preformed.

1. Starting with emlusion add 200 uL CAT

2. Spin down for 30 seconds at 100 x g (in simple centrifuge at heidi's bench)

3. Pipette oil out from bottom

4. add two times volume of pico break and gently rock tube

5. spin again for 1 min at 100-1000 x g

6. pipette out top(cells) ~ 200 uL

Reactions ~200 uL were transfered to another tube tube and brought up to 600 uL with CAT

Reactions were incubated for 60 minutes at 37 C.

**Dilution Scheme**

150 uL pipetted into 1.5 mL CAT to make 10^-3, 3xRNS, 3xRS, 3xRN, one for further dilution

150 uL pipetted into 1.5 mL CAT to make 10^-4

150 uL pipetted into 1.5 mL CAT to make 10^-5

150 uL pipettd into 1.5 mL CAT to make 10^-6, 3xR, 3xS

*I mistakenly diluted too much. I intended to plate at 10^-2 for crosses and 10^-5 for counts*

**Plates are filled with:**

1. 150 uL CAT agar
2. 75 uL cells + 75 uL agar
3. 150 uL CAT agar
4. 150 uL Drug agar

**spectinomycin was substituted for streptomycin accidentally*

## Discussion and Conclusion

Plated concentration was too low to get a good count. The control count is also low and now crosses were observed. RS is a false positive; Spectinomycin was accidentally not used.

## Appendix:

To CAT from stock shelf add phosphate and glucose.
For 300 mL CAT add 10 mL of 0.5 M K2HPO4 (sterile filtered) and 3 mL of 20% glucose (sterile filtered).
