### Attack Reaction

**Cell Prep:**

| For 12 mL growth tubes: | OD   |
|-------------------------|------|
| *Resuspend Volume (mL)  | 0.75 |
| *Desired OD in Reaction | 1    |
| Cell mix                | 2    |
| Each Srain resuspended  | 4    |
| ***Grow to***                | ***0.25*** |

1. Take 2 x 12 mL tubes of cell suspension and spin down at 8k rcf for 8 min in chilled incubator.

2. Pour off supernatant and resuspend in M9.

3. Combine 350 uL of each strain to make 700 uL cell mix.

4. Pull 350 uL of cell mix into syringe

**Inducer Prep:**

Produce 700 uL of double strength inducer in M9 and pull 500 uL into a syringe:

| cell suspension volume to match | 700   |       |         |           |               |            |
|---------------------------------|-------|-------|---------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| Component                       | Stock | unit  | Inducer | Dilute by | Working Stock | 2x inducer |

**typically 0.04 % of BSA is used, it was reduced to prevent fouling of hydrophobic device*

**Preparing Working Stocks:**

| Working Stocks | Stock  | M9   | dH2O |
|----------------|--------|------|------|
| CSP            | 25 uL  | 1 mL | -    |
| BSA            | 100 uL | 1 mL | -    |
| CaCl2          | 100 uL | -    | 1 mL |

| M9 Media       | 1000 mL | 10 mL M9 |
|----------------|---------|----------|
| dH20 mL        | 700     | 7        |
| M9 Salts mL    | 200     | 2        |
| 20% glucose mL | 20      | 0.2      |
| MgSO4 mL       | 2       | 0.02     |
| **CaCl2 uL**       | 100     | 1*       |

**10 uL can be added from the diluted inducer stock rather than 1 ul from standard stock*

**Reaction Scheme:**

Droplet production was performed in the cold room.
When cells combine with inducer in droplet device they will be diluted to OD of 1 each.
The remaining cell mix and inducer was kept in the cold room to be combined as a control.
After the device chamber is full of emulsion the heated stage is turned to 37C, and the control cells are placed in a heated block.

*The entire chamber is not full of droplets. The generator failed about half-way through. A long 'string' of fouled area formed causing jetting rather then nice droplet formation. Flow rate of 50 ul/h was used for oil and 10 uL/h for the aqueous.*

*reaction started at: 3:20*

**Emlusion Breaking**

Emulsion is flowed from the device after 30 min into a centrifuge tube.
Both reaction tubes were taken out and placed at room temperature while emulsion breaking was preformed.

1. Starting with emlusion add 200 uL CAT

2. Spin down for 30 seconds at 100 x g (in simple centrifuge at heidi's bench)

3. Pipette oil out from bottom

4. add two times volume of pico break and gently rock tube

5. spin again for 1 min at 100-1000 x g

6. pipette out top(cells) ~ 200 uL

Reactions ~200 uL were transfered to another tube tube and brought up to 400 uL with CAT

Reactions were incubated for 60 minutes at 37 C.

*Incubation started at:*

**Dilution Scheme**

Assume 4 uL of suspension is extracted from the emulsion.

extracted suspension is brought up to 400 uL = 10^-2, (Incubation concentration)

75 uL plated into 3 wells, 10^-2, 3xRNS

75 uL transfered into 750 uL CAT to make 10^-3, plate 75 uL into 3xRS, 3xRN

75 uL pipetted into 7.5 mL CAT to make 10^-5, plate 75 uL into 3xR, 3xS.


**Plates are filled with:**

24-well plates used:

1. 150 uL CAT agar
2. 75 uL cells + 75 uL agar
3. 150 uL CAT agar
4. 150 uL Drug agar

## Discussion and Conclusion

No transformation was observed in droplets or in control. No S resistant cells survived (CP2215) droplets. R resistant counts from droplets were also low.

## Appendix:

To CAT from stock shelf add phosphate and glucose.
For 300 mL CAT add 10 mL of 0.5 M K2HPO4 (sterile filtered) and 3 mL of 20% glucose (sterile filtered).
