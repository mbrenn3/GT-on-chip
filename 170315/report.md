###Attack Reaction

**Cell Prep:**

Take 2 x 12 mL tubes of cell suspension and spin down at 8k rcf for 8 min in chilled incubator.

Pour off supernatant and resuspend in 0.5 mL M9 to make OD 4.0.

Combine 250 uL of each strain to make 500 uL cells each at OD 2.0.

Pull 350 uL of cell mix into syringe

Pull 350 uL of inducer into second syringe

| Syringe | Contents                      |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| 1       | Cell mix, each strain at OD = 2.0 |
| 2       | Inducer 2x concentration      |
**Inducer Prep:**

Produce 700 uL of double strength inducer in M9 and pull 500 uL into a syringe:

| cell suspension volume to match | 700   |       |         |           |               |            |
|---------------------------------|-------|-------|---------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| Component                       | Stock | unit  | Inducer | Dilute by | Working Stock | 2x inducer |
| CSP                             | 250   | ug/mL | 0.1     | 50        | 5             | 28         |
| BSA                             | 4     | %     | 0.004*  | 10        | 0.4           | 14         |
| CaCl2                           | 1     | M     | 0.005   | 10        | 0.1           | 70         |
| M9                              |       |       |         |           |               | 588        |

**typically 0.04 % of BSA is used, it was reduced to prevent fouling of hydrophobic device*

**Preparing Working Stocks:**

| Working Stocks | Stock  | M9   | dH2O |
|----------------|--------|------|------|
| CSP            | 25 uL  | 1 mL | -    |
| BSA            | 100 uL | 1 mL | -    |
| CaCl2          | 100 uL | -    | 1 mL |


**Reaction Scheme:**

Droplet production was performed in the cold room.
When cells combine with inducer in droplet device they will be diluted to 0.1 each.
The remaining cell mix and inducer was kept in the cold room to be combined as a control.
After the device chamber is full of emulsion the heated stage is turned to 37C, and the control cells are placed in a heated block.
