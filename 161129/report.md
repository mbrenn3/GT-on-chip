Thaw Stock cells @ 0C. Stock: box Morrison 2017. Dilute for growth in CDM + 1% CAT 12mL/tube.

CDM CAT and M9 used were filtered with a luer-lock filter (0.22 uM)

Grow to OD of 0.1 and chill.

###Attack Reaction

**Cell Prep:**

Take 2 x 12 mL tubes of cell suspension and spin down at 8k rcf for 8 min in chilled incubator.

Pour off supernatant and resuspend in 3 mL M9 to make OD 0.4.

Combine 300 uL of each strain to make 600 uL cells each at OD 0.2.

Pull 500 uL of cell mix into syringe

**Inducer Prep:**

Produce 700 uL of double strength inducer in M9 and pull 500 uL into a syringe:

**typically 0.04 % of BSA is used, it was reduced to prevent fouling of hydrophobic device*

**Preparing Working Stocks:**

| Working Stocks | Stock  | M9   | dH2O |
|----------------|--------|------|------|
| CSP            | 25 uL  | 1 mL | -    |
| BSA            | 100 uL | 1 mL | -    |
| CaCl2          | 100 uL | -    | 1 mL |


**Reaction Scheme:**

Droplet production was performed in the cold room.
When cells combine with inducer in droplet device they will be diluted to 0.1 each.
The remaining cell mix and inducer was kept in the cold room to be combined as a control.
After 100 uL was pumped through the device (resulting in about 200 uL of droplets in oil)
The emulsion and control reaction are placed in a heat block at 37C for 30 minutes

*reaction started at:*

**Emlusion Breaking**

Both reaction tubes were taken out and placed at room temperature while emulsion breaking was formed

1. Starting with 200 uL cells in emlusion add 500 uL CAT

2. Spin down for 30 seconds at 100 x g (in simple centrifuge at heidi's bench)

3. Pipette oil out from bottom

4. add two times volume of pico break and gently rock tube

5. spin again for 1 min at 100-1000 x g

6. pipette out top(cells) ~ 700 uL

Reactions ~200 uL were transfered to another tube tube and brought up to 2 mL with CAT

Reactions were incubated for 60 minutes at 37 C.

**Dilution Scheme**

150 uL pipetted into 1.5 mL CAT to make 10^-2, 3xRNS, 3xRS, 3xRN, one for further dilution

## Discussion and Conclusion

Cell pellet didn't make it?
Holding at 4C in M9 kills cells?
M9 old?

Should I check droplet formation in newly coated devices with CDM or CAT?

## Appendix:

To CAT from stock shelf add phosphate and glucose. For 300 mL CAT add 10 mL 0.5 M K2HPO4 (sterile filtered) and 3 mL 20% glucose (sterile filtered).
