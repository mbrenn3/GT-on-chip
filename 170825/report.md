### Attack Reaction

**Cell Prep:**

| For 12 mL growth tubes: | OD   |
|-------------------------|------|
| *Resuspend Volume (mL)  | 0.75 |
| *Desired OD in Reaction | 1    |
| Cell mix                | 2    |
| Each Strain resuspended  | 4    |
| ***Grow to***           | ***0.25*** |

1. Take 2 x 12 mL tubes of cell suspension and spin down at 8k rcf for 8 min in chilled incubator.

2. Pour off supernatant and resuspend in M9.

3. Combine 350 uL of each strain to make 700 uL cell mix.

4. Pull 350 uL of cell mix into syringe

**Inducer Prep:**

Produce 700 uL of double strength inducer in M9 and pull 350 uL into a syringe:

| cell suspension volume to match | 700   |       |         |           |               |            |
|---------------------------------|-------|-------|---------|-----------|---------------|------------|

**typically 0.04 % of BSA is used, it was reduced to prevent fouling of hydrophobic device*

**Preparing Working Stocks:**

| Working Stocks | Stock  | M9   | dH2O |
|----------------|--------|------|------|
| CSP            | 25 uL  | 1 mL | -    |
| BSA            | 100 uL | 1 mL | -    |
| CaCl2          | 100 uL | -    | 1 mL |

| M9 Media       | 1000 mL | 10 mL M9 |
|----------------|---------|----------|
| dH2O mL        | 700     | 7        |
| M9 Salts mL    | 200     | 2        |
| 20% glucose mL | 20      | 0.2      |
| MgSO4 mL       | 2       | 0.02     |
| **CaCl2 uL**   | 100     | 1*       |

**10 uL can be added from the diluted inducer stock rather than 1 uL from standard stock*

**Reaction Scheme:**

Droplet production was performed at the bench top.
When cells combine with inducer in droplet device they will be diluted to OD of 1 each.
The remaining cell mix and inducer was kept to be combined in equal parts as a control.
Once droplets began forming satisfactorily new tubing is placed in the outlet channel.
Droplets were generated with an aqueous flow rate of 10 uL/hr for 5 minutes and then increased to 25 uL/hr for 5 minutes.
An estimate based on the flowrate and time calculates 2.9 uL of droplets produced.
Aqueous tubing was pulled from the device to stop droplet production while oil continued to flow.
The the outlet tubing was removed and crimped at both ends with a binder paper clip.
The tubing was then immersed in a 15 mL conical tube of sterile water which was placed in a 37C water bath.
As a control 200 uL of cell mix was combined with 200 uL inducer and placed in a 37C heater block.

*reaction started at: __:__*

**Emulsion Breaking**

Emulsion is flowed from the tubing into a centrifuge tube.
Both reaction tubes were placed at room temperature while emulsion breaking was preformed.

1. Starting with emulsion in oil, add 250 uL CAT

2. Spin down for 30 seconds at 100 x g (in simple centrifuge at Heidi's bench)

3. Pipette oil out from bottom

4. add two times volume of pico break and gently rock tube, 500 uL total.

5. spin again for 1 min at 100-1000 x g

6. pipette out top(cells) ~ 250 uL

Both droplet and control reactions were incubated for 60 minutes at 37 C.

*Incubation started at : 4:20*

**Dilution Scheme**

Assume 2.5 uL of suspension is extracted from the emulsion.
2.5 uL was also pipetted from the control reaction tube and into 250 mL CAT

extracted suspension is brought up to 250 uL = 10^-2, (60 min Incubation concentration)

2 volumes of 75 uL plated into 2 wells, 10^-2, 2xRNS

75 uL transfered into 750 uL CAT to make 10^-3, plate 75 uL into 3xRS, 3xRN

75 uL pipetted into 7.5 mL CAT to make 10^-5, plate 75 uL into 3xR, 3xS.


**Plates are filled with:**

24-well plates used:

1. 150 uL CAT agar
2. 75 uL cells + 75 uL agar
3. 150 uL CAT agar
4. 150 uL Drug agar

## Discussion and Conclusion

No transformation was observed in both the droplets or the control. No CFUs were observed in the droplet reaction. Cell counts for the control were slightly lower than expected. We would expect to see counts in the 10^9 range.

## Appendix:

To CAT from stock shelf add phosphate and glucose.
For 300 mL CAT add 10 mL of 0.5 M K2HPO4 (sterile filtered) and 3 mL of 20% glucose (sterile filtered).
